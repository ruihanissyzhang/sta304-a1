 Introduction This dataset is about the outbreaks in Toronto healthcare institutions (including hospitals, long-term care homes and retirement homes). These healthcare institutions have the responsibility to monitor staff and patients/residents for signs and symptoms of gastroenteric and respiratory such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, cough, runny nose and sore throat. If the rate of infection or illness increase locally or higher than expectation,we call it “outbreak”.</description>
